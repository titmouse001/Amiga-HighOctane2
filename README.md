# Amiga 68000 Assembly for High-Octane II
This code was never finished and will probably never will be. I'm uploading it as a backup/archive in case others find it useful - there's some stuff in here that might be worth referencing.
I've also included a compiled executable of the game (run 'UltimateOctane' it can load from workbench). I did test built this very recently mainly to remind myself how everything worked. I used an emulated Amiga A1200 setup that mirrors my original setup with a boot and data drives.
